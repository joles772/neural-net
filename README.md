# neural-net

# This project can be openend with IntelliJ, the parameters of the neural net must be manually set in the TestHarness file (There are initial parameters and the app will run as is).
Note this application is very slow due to the amount of calculations performed

A neural network programmed in Java, which analyzes handwritten digits. The neural network is trained on a training data set (which includes handwritten digits and their correct classifications) to classify handwritten digits. The neural network is then able to classify digits from other data sets. Various algorithms and methods are used to classify the digits and the accuracy of these methods is investigated. The project includes a research paper which explains the data sets, algorithms, and methods used; and investigates the accuracy of said algorithms and methods using statistical analysis.
